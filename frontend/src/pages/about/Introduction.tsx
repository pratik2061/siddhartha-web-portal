                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  Siddhartha English Boarding Secondary School (SEBS) stands as a beacon of educational excellence 
                  in Butwal, Nepal. Established with the vision of providing world-class education that goes beyond 
                  traditional teaching methods, we have been shaping young minds for over two and a half decades.
                </p>

                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  Our institution is built on the foundation of academic rigor, character development, and holistic 
                  growth. We believe that education in today's context carries a much wider scope than yesteryears. 
                  In this age of globalization, education must be of international standards, extending far beyond 
                  textbooks and examinations to encompass the overall development of every student.
                </p>

                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
                  At SEBS, we are committed to value-based quality education that prepares students not just for 
                  academic success, but for life itself. Our dedicated faculty, modern facilities, and innovative 
                  teaching methodologies create an environment where students can discover their potential and 
                  develop into confident, capable, and compassionate individuals.
